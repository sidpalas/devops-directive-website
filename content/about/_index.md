My goal with DevOps Directive is to provide educational and entertaining (hopefully?...) content to enable engineers to level up their skills and keep up with the continuously evolving DevOps and Cloud Infrastructure landscape.

I will be exploring many different types of media, including:
- [Video Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4MdpjzjPuop_qWNAvR23JA)
- [Open Source Projects](https://github.com/sidpalas)
- Interviews
- Live & Recorded Screen Casts
- Internet Office Hours
- [Interpretive Song and Dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0)

Topics include:
- Infrastructure as Code
- Kubernetes
- Databases
- Networking
- Security
- Continuous Integration
- Continuous Deployment
- Monitoring
- Cloud Providers
- Career Advancement

I am not an expert in all of these topics. I'm actually not an expert in ANY of these topics. That being said, I am good at [Reading the Docs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM), asking the right questions, and explaining what I learn along the way.

Join me!

-Sid
